Sewickley Spring League 2024 has arrived! 6 teams will do battle tonight at all 3 Sewickley clubs. Check the [schedule page](/schedule) to make sure you know where your team is playing tonight.

Matches start at 7:30pm (feel free to come earlier to warm up!). Lines 1-4 will start first with lines 5 and 6 to follow (if available) unless otherwise noted by your team captains.

There will be no food provided during Spring League, so don't come hungry!

After a rainy start to the week, it looks like we've lucked out with the weather and it's going to be a perfect evening for paddle.
