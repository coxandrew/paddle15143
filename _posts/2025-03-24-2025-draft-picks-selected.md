The 2025 Sewickley Spring League (SSL) season is upon us! Last night, in a smoke-filled room, all 80 members of the 2025 Sewickley Spring League were drafted amongst the 6 teams. Expect to receive a welcome email from your captain if you haven't already. Check out the [teams](/teams) page to see where everyone ended up.

Just like last year, we will be fielding as many lines as we can each week and ALL lines will count for the standings to determine the 2 teams that play for the championship (as long as a floater sub wasn't used).

Check out the [schedule](/schedule) and mark your calendars to make sure family events don't encroach on the best thing going in Western Pennsylvania. See you on the courts!
