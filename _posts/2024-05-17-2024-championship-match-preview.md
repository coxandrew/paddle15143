The Sewickley Spring League 2024 Championship teams have been determined!

## Semi-finals Recap

Going into week 7, the Haymakers had sewn up the top position, so the only question remaining was: who would they face in the first blended-team Sewickley Spring League Championship?

The Cox Slashers faced Duncan's Donuts at the YMCA in the semi-final match Thursday night. The winner would face the Haymakers in the finals. On paper, the Slashers had a signficant advantage, but the Donuts pulled out all the stops and secured a spot in the finals with a 5-4 team win.
