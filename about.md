## Spring League 2025

Spring League 2025 is almost here! This year will continue the successful formula of a 6-team draft league, mixing players from all 3 Sewickley clubs. This blended-team approach produces more balanced teams and promises competitive lines every week. It's going to rock.

| What      | How |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Dates**      | Thursdays from 3/27 - 5/15 (8 weeks)       |
| **Time**   | 7:30pm (feel free to come earlier to warm up)       |
| **Location**   | See [Schedule](/schedule/)        |
| **Refreshments**   | Beer will be provided (no food)        |
| **Lines**   | We'll set as many lines as we can (4, 5, 6?) and all will count toward the % of sets won in the standings.        |
| **Finals** | The top 2 teams will battle it out in the Spring League Championship on Thursday, 5/15. Teams 3-6 will also play it out for consolation bragging rights. |
